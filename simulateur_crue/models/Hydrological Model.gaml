/** Inspired by the model of :

* Name: Hydrological Model
* Author: Patrick Taillandier
* Description: A model showing how to represent a flooding system with dykes and buildings. It uses 
* 	a grid to discretize space, and has a 3D display. The water can flow from one cell to another considering 
* 	the height of the cells, and the water pressure. It is also possible to delete dyke by clicking on one of them 
* 	in the display.
